The Expense Tracker is a web application designed to help people keep track of their spending. It will allow for them
input expenses and savings goals, which the application will then use to calculate averages and totals as well as 
generate graphs. All of these functions will combine to show the user how they can reach their savings goals
and how they can better manage their spending
